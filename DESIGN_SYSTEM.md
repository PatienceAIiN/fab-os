# Fab OS design system

Source of truth: `fab-ui/design-system/tokens/tokens.json`. Consumers:

| Surface | How tokens reach it |
|---------|---------------------|
| Plasma shell (panels, popups, tooltips, tray, notifications) | `brand/gen/plasma_theme.py` → FabOS Plasma theme; colours follow the active colour scheme through KSvg `current-color-scheme` classes; radii from `radius.panel/popup` |
| Qt/KDE applications | Fab Dark / Fab Light colour schemes (generated in `fabos-desktop` postinst from Breeze structure + token colours); Breeze widget style; fonts from `/etc/xdg/kdeglobals` |
| Fab OS apps (Command Center, Updates, Feedback, Welcome) | Qt palette roles (`palette(base)`, `palette(highlight)`, …) so they follow the scheme; radii/spacing from tokens |
| Ask bar plasmoid | `Kirigami.Theme` colours; motion durations from `motion.duration` |
| Icons | FabOS icon theme: Material Symbols glyph on a tile with `radius.iconTile`, tile colours from `color.iconTiles`; falls back to Breeze |
| Greeter, splash, boot | generated PNG/SVG assets from `brand/gen/make_assets.py` |
| Website | CSS variables mirroring the dark semantic set |

Rules: no hard-coded colours in Fab OS code (palette or Kirigami.Theme only); one radius scale; Inter everywhere;
animations from the motion tokens and disabled under Reduce Motion; every state (loading/empty/error/disabled)
must be visible and truthful.

Components in use (UI_COMPONENT_CATALOG.md lists them): Plasma/Kirigami controls for the shell, Qt Widgets
(Breeze) for Fab OS apps. A Fab-authored widget kit is a later phase; until then consistency comes from the
shared scheme, fonts, radii and icon language.
