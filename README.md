## What Fab OS is

Fab OS™ is a complete desktop OS built on Ubuntu 26.04 LTS. It looks and feels like its own product — its own boot splash, greeter, theme, icons, and app names — but every Ubuntu command, package, `.deb`, Flatpak, and Docker workflow keeps working exactly as it does on Ubuntu. Ubuntu security updates still flow from Ubuntu; Fab OS features and branding updates flow from Patience AI's own signed repository.

The difference is the **home screen**. Instead of hunting through menus, you type what you want into one bar — *"open the editor, write the release notes, and email them to the team"* — and the built-in agent does it, at the level of the real operating system, with your permission.

> **Status: public pre-release (v1.0).** Solid to try and build; expect rough edges and please report them.

## The agent, in one screen

The desktop's centrepiece is the **"Ask me to do anything…"** bar. Behind it runs a local agent daemon (`fabos-agentd`, bound to `127.0.0.1`, bearer-token authenticated) that can actually operate the machine:

| It can | Tools |
|---|---|
| Run commands, as you or (with approval) as root | `run_shell` |
| Read, write, and list files | `read_file` · `write_file` · `list_dir` |
| Open and drive apps, type into them | `open_app` · `type_text` · `list_apps` |
| Send and check mail | `send_email` · `check_email` |
| Fetch the web, watch for things to happen | `web_fetch` · `schedule_watch` |
| Ask you a question, notify you | `ask_user` · `notify_user` |

**You stay in control.** Every action is scored by a deterministic risk classifier (LOW → CRITICAL) and gated by a permission mode:

- **Ask** — approve each risky step.
- **Auto** — the agent proceeds, pausing only for high-risk actions.
- **Bypass** — full autonomy, for when you trust the task.

A single **System-Wide AI** switch turns the whole thing off. Nothing leaves your machine except the requests you give the agent, sent only to the provider you configure yourself: **Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or a fully local model** (llama.cpp — offline). No telemetry, no accounts, no crash uploads.

Everything the agent does is recorded and shown as a chat in **Fab AI Controls**: your requests on the right, the agent's answers on the left, and every tool step folded into a small "Worked: N actions" chip you can expand. Follow up in the same chat and the agent keeps the context; hover a message to edit, retry, or copy it; stop a running task with one click; and every risky step, delete, or mode change asks you first in a rounded confirmation dialog (approval requests show exactly what would run behind "Show details" — opened for you when the risk is high).

## What's in the box

- **Apps you already know:** Firefox (Mozilla's own build), LibreOffice, VLC, plus the Fab suite — Fab Files, Fab Terminal, Fab Editor, Fab Software, Fab Photos, Fab Documents, Fab Calculator, Fab Screenshot, Fab Monitor, Fab System Info, Weather.
- **Fab AI Controls** — chat with the agent: searchable history grouped by day, follow-ups with context, approvals, the System-Wide AI switch, and settings. Launch it with Meta+Space (`fabos-command-center`).
- **Fab Updates** — one place for updates, with Standard and Beta channels.
- **Fab Feedback** — send a bug or idea straight to the team.
- **Welcome to Fab OS** — a first-run wizard for appearance, privacy, and connecting an AI provider.

## Design

| Piece | What |
|---|---|
| Desktop | KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland; Fab OS look-and-feel in dark and light, following the system colour scheme everywhere |
| Type | Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code |
| Icons | Google Material Symbols on Fab OS tiles for system apps; third-party apps keep their own icons |
| Motion | Rounded, animated surfaces; Overview and edge-tiling for multitasking; multi-monitor extend/duplicate |
| Windows | Drag a window to a side edge for a half, to a corner for a quarter, to the top to maximise. Hold **Shift** while dragging to drop it into a tile layout (**Meta+T** edits the layouts, **Meta+Arrows** quick-tile from the keyboard). After a window snaps to one half, **Snap Assist** shows the other open windows so you can pick one for the remaining half ([ADR-0011](docs/decisions/ADR-0011-window-snapping.md)) |
| Identity | Original Fab OS mark, wallpapers, and boot splash, rendered from source at every resolution up to 4K |

Design docs live in [`docs/design/`](docs/design/). Decisions are recorded as ADRs in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).

## Minimum requirements

| | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | **2 GB RAM** | Fab OS ships compressed swap in RAM (zram, half of RAM) and keeps background services on demand, so 2 GB runs the full desktop with every effect on. 4 GB recommended for large documents and many browser tabs. |
| Disk | **20 GB** | The installed system is about 7 GB; the rest is for updates, Flatpaks and your files. |
| Processor / firmware | **64-bit (x86-64), UEFI** | Secure Boot works (Ubuntu's signed kernel and shim). Legacy BIOS is not supported. |
| Graphics | any GPU with a Mesa or vendor driver | Wayland-only desktop. |

What is tuned for small machines, and how to change it back, is in [`docs/LOW-RAM.md`](docs/LOW-RAM.md).

## Install Fab OS

1. **Download the ISO** (about 2.3 GB) from [fabos.patienceai.in](https://fabos.patienceai.in).
2. **Write it to a USB stick** (8 GB or larger) with [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) — free, and the same click-and-go steps on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
3. **Restart** and pick the USB stick from your computer's boot menu (usually F12, F2, or Esc at power-on).
4. **Try it live** — Fab OS runs from the stick without touching your disk. When you're ready, open **Install Fab OS** on the desktop.
5. **Verify the download** (optional): `sha256sum -c fabos-1.0-desktop-amd64.iso.sha256`.

After first login, connect an AI provider in **Fab AI Controls → Settings** to turn the agent on. It stays off until you do.

## Build it yourself

Fab OS builds with rootless `podman` — no root, no host contamination. The build is a multi-stage container image exported to a bootable disk.

**Prerequisites** (Ubuntu/Fedora host): `podman`, `qemu-system-x86_64`, `ovmf`, `python3` with Pillow, and about 20 GB free disk.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatienceAIiN/fab-os.git
cd fab-os

# 1. Build the root filesystem (VM profile) and export it to ext4
MIRROR=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu scripts/build-rootfs.sh vm

# 2. Assemble a bootable GPT disk (UEFI, systemd-boot)
scripts/make-disk.sh vm

# 3. Boot it in QEMU/KVM (add --headless for no window, --heads 2 for dual display)
scripts/boot-vm.sh
```

Set `MIRROR` to a fast Ubuntu mirror near you; it affects downloads only — the shipped OS always points at the official archive.

### Build the installer ISO

```bash
scripts/build-rootfs.sh iso      # casper live rootfs + Calamares installer
scripts/build-iso.sh             # -> build/fabos-1.0-desktop-amd64.iso
tests/iso-boot-test.sh           # headless live-boot smoke test
```

### Test it

```bash
tests/branding-check.sh vm       # 60+ static checks: identity, no Canonical/KDE names, legal files present
tests/ui-tour.sh                 # boots headless, drives the UI, captures screenshots to build/screenshots/
python3 tests/agent-test.py      # agent unit tests (offline, FakeProvider)
```

The build is designed to be **cache-friendly and honest**: `build-rootfs.sh` refuses to export a stale image if a build step fails, and never re-downloads the desktop layer unless you change it.

## How updates work

Fab OS keeps two update streams, both automatic and both signed:

- **Ubuntu** security and package updates come from the Ubuntu archive, unchanged.
- **Fab OS** feature, AI, and branding updates come from Patience AI's signed repository at `https://fabos.patienceai.in/apt` (suites `loom` for Standard, `loom-beta` for Beta).

`apt`, `flatpak`, and everything else you know work normally.

---

## Security defaults

- **AppArmor** on, with Ubuntu's profiles unchanged.
- **Secure Boot** works: Ubuntu's signed kernel and shim, unmodified.
- **Firewall on** from the first boot: ufw denies incoming and allows outgoing connections, with no extra rules; the shipped image has no SSH server. `sudo ufw status` shows it, `sudo ufw allow <port>` opens a port.
- **Full-disk encryption** (LUKS2) is pre-selected in the installer.
- **Signed updates only**: Ubuntu's archive keys and the Fab OS Archive key. Nothing is downloaded on first use — every model, voice, font and icon ships in the ISO.
- **No telemetry**, no analytics, no accounts ([legal/PRIVACY.md](legal/PRIVACY.md)).
- **The agent is gated by permissions**: it runs as you, stays off until you add a provider key, asks before risky steps, and reaches root only through a single-use, policy-checked path ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## Legal & licensing

Fab OS is free and open source. **Own code is Apache-2.0** ([LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE)). Upstream components keep their own licences, preserved and documented:

- **[LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md)** — how the pieces fit together.
- **[ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md)** and **[THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/)** — every third-party component and its licence text.
- **[legal/](legal/)** — trademark notes, the Ubuntu-derivative compliance record, the GPL source offer, the privacy statement, the list of length-preserving string patches, and the open-source release checklist.

Trademark note: **Ubuntu** is a trademark of Canonical Ltd.; **KDE** and **Plasma** are trademarks of KDE e.V.; **Firefox** is a trademark of the Mozilla Foundation (Fab OS ships Mozilla's own unmodified build). Fab OS is an independent project and is **not endorsed by** any of them. All Ubuntu/Canonical and KDE trademarks and logos are removed from the product surface; the underlying free software and its copyright notices are unchanged.

No telemetry, no analytics, no accounts. See [legal/PRIVACY.md](legal/PRIVACY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
